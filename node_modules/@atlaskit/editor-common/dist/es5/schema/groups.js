// # What do marks exist?
//
// Marks are categorised into different groups. One motivation for this was to allow the `code` mark
// to exclude other marks, without needing to explicitly name them. Explicit naming requires the
// named mark to exist in the schema. This is undesirable because we want to construct different
// schemas that have different sets of nodes/marks.
//
// Groups provide a level of indirection, and solve this problem. For the immediate use-case, one
// group called "not_code" would have sufficed, but this an ultra-specialised to code.
